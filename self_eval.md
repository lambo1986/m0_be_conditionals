# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? 
Conditionals seem to be extremely useful for many reasons, and I imagine they can be found throughout most programs, if not all. They are used to change the control flow of the code, and create differences that separate variables for different uses. Most, if not all programming languages use them, so it's a key concept to master. 
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I want to practice this whole lesson several times so I can fully comprehend the logic behind conditionals. Truly understanding and visualizing the math is key for me, or else I won't retain much.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
I love problem solving, so long as I have time to think! I love seeing the terminal spit the output of my code, and I enjoy taking a rest and coming back to a challenge, to find that I understand it a little bit better.
